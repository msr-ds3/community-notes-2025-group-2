## Replications and extensions of "Community Based Fact Checking on Twitter's Birdwatch Platform"

This study uses Birdwatch public data released by Twitter (now X) to explore how community-sourced fact-checking works. We replicated **Figures 2-4**, **5c**, and **7-10** using publicly available Birdwatch data and additional source tweet data kindly shared with us by Nicolas Prollochs, which was used in the original research paper.

## Replication
1. Install tidyverse, knitr, stringr, broom and MASS libraries.
2. Run the code from the finalReport.Rmd R Markdown file.
3. Alternatively, you can [click this link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/msr-ds3/community-notes-2025-group-2/ca43da70fa92908b98622bddd4f7f8b9897cca2b/final_report.html) to view the results of the replication without running the code. 
 
## Data from the paper
